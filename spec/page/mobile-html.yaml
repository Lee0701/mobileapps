      summary: Get page content HTML optimized for mobile consumption
      description: |
        Gets the content HTML optimized for mobile consumption for the given page. This content
        is derived from Parsoid HTML (see `/page/html/{title}` endpoint).
        The difference to Parsoid HTML is roughly:
        * Some elements and attributes not needed for the reading case are removed.
        * LeadIntroductionTransform: The introductory paragraph is moved before an infobox.
        * RedLinks: Red links are flattened (=turned into span elements).
        * WidenImage: images that should be displayed in gallery are widened.
        * Section headings are slightly changed by wrapping the headings inside a div and adding
          a span element inside the new div for the edit buttons.
        * Additional classes are added to img elements to fix issues with non-white backgrounds.
          See Theme support below for instructions on how to enable that.
        * Pagelib CSS files needed to display the content are referenced.
        * LazyLoadTransform: server-side portion/prep for lazy loading of images.

        What's not included? What parts of the PageLibrary does a client still have to do?
        * Theme support: Themes can be turned on by adding a theme class to the root <html> tag.
          Possible class names are:
          * `pagelib_theme_default`
          * `pagelib_theme_dark`
          * `pagelib_theme_black`
          * `pagelib_theme_sepia`

          The pagelib JS has functionality to do that: ThemeTransform.setTheme(document, theme).
        * Dim images: DimImagesTransform.dim(window, enable)
        * PlatformTransform.classify(window) to trigger Android and iOS app specific CSS rules
        * LazyLoadTransformer: client side companion of LazyLoadTransform (note the extra *er*
        here)
        * CollapseTable: server-side portion/prep for collapsing tables.
        * FooterTransformer: seems to be more UI than content, requires I18N, too
