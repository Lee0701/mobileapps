<p>Headings introduce sections and subsections, clarify articles by breaking up text, organize content, and populate the <a href="./Wikipedia:TOC" title="Wikipedia:TOC" class="mw-redirect">table of contents</a>.</p>

<p>Headings follow a six-level hierarchy, starting at 1 and ending at 6. The level of the heading is defined by the number of equal signs on either side of the title. Heading 1 (<code>=Heading<span>&nbsp;</span>1=</code>) is automatically generated as the
  title of the article, and is never appropriate within the body of articles. Sections start at the second level (<code>==Heading<span>&nbsp;</span>2==</code>), with subsections at the third level (<code>===Heading<span>&nbsp;</span>3===</code>), and
  additional levels of subsections at the fourth level (<code>====Heading<span>&nbsp;</span>4====</code>), fifth level, and sixth level. Sections should be consecutive, such that they do not skip levels from sections to sub-subsections; the exact methodology
  is part of the <a href="./Wikipedia:ACCESS" title="Wikipedia:ACCESS" class="mw-redirect">Accessibility</a> guideline.<span class="mw-ref" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="./User:BSitzmann_(WMF)/MCS/Test/Frankenstein#cite_note-3" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 3;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[3]</span></a>
