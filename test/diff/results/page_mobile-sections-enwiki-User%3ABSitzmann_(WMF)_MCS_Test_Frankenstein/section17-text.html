  Wikipedia has no general standards or guidelines for what section headings are expected in the bodies of articles or what order they should take, because the diversity of presentation in various Wikipedia subjects is too great. The usual practice is to
  name and order sections based on the precedent of some article which seems similar. There was no early standard proposed, and there is no general outline to follow. Contributors are advised to follow their instincts in proposing an order for sections
  in the body then seek community consensus in establishing a final order.</p>

<p id="mwoA">The order of sections in the body of a Wikipedia article may be recommended by a relevant WikiProject, or may not exist at all for some topics. Some WikiProjects have developed their own topical style <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Council/Guide#Advice_pages"
    title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Guide" id="mwoQ">advice pages</a> which include section naming and ordering recommendations. Here are some examples from <a href="/wiki/Category:WikiProject_style_advice" title="Category:WikiProject style advice"
