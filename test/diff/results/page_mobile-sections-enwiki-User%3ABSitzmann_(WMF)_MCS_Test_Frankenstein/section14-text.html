<p>Headings introduce sections and subsections, clarify articles by breaking up text, organize content, and populate the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:TOC" title="Wikipedia:TOC">table of contents</a>.</p>

<p>Headings follow a six-level hierarchy, starting at 1 and ending at 6. The level of the heading is defined by the number of equal signs on either side of the title. Heading 1 (<code id="mwkQ">=Heading<span>&nbsp;</span>1=</code>) is automatically generated
  as the title of the article, and is never appropriate within the body of articles. Sections start at the second level (<code id="mwkw">==Heading<span>&nbsp;</span>2==</code>), with subsections at the third level (<code id="mwlQ">===Heading<span>&nbsp;</span>3===</code>),
  and additional levels of subsections at the fourth level (<code id="mwlw">====Heading<span>&nbsp;</span>4====</code>), fifth level, and sixth level. Sections should be consecutive, such that they do not skip levels from sections to sub-subsections;
  the exact methodology is part of the <a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:ACCESS" title="Wikipedia:ACCESS">Accessibility</a> guideline.<span class="mw-ref"><a href="#cite_note-3" style="counter-reset: mw-Ref 3;"><span class="mw-reflink-text">[3]</span></a>
